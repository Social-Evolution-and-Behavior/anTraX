```

The app will a randomly selected assigment if ID to a blob. Respond by pressing either "Correct", "Incorrect", or "Can't say". The txt box will display the accumulated error and its confidence interval. Use the 'Assigment' menu to estimate the error for a specific ID, time range, or colony (for multi colony experiments).
